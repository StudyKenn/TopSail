          <h2>Name</h2>
          <p class="col">
            Folklore states that the island was named Topsail because pirate ships hid behind the island with their topsails visible from the sea. the name then stemmed from New Topsail Inlet. This inlet's name can be discovered on very early navigational charts. Soon after J.G. Anderson developed the southend of the island and named it New Topsail Beach, the island has since been called Topsail.

          <h2>Origin</h2>
          <p class="col">
            Before World War II TopSail Island was only accessible by boat. Residents would travel to the shores and picnic or let their animals graze on the wild grass. A few buildings were built along the Atlantic Ocean and were used as shelter for fishing trips and summer vacations.
          </p>

          <p class="col">  
            During the beginning of the war, the U.S army built a training base at Holly Ridge and claimed the island. They also built training facilities and support buildings in what is now known as the Surf City buisness district.
          </p>

          <p class="col">
            After the war island was turned over to the Navy and they began a project with Johns Hopkins University called Operation Bumblebee (an early missile development program). In 1948, the island was returned to the original owners and since the TopSail grew as we know it.
          </p>

          <p class="col">
            In 1963, TopSail Beach evolved into a friendly and family oriented beach living. High development is forbidden and the town works very hard to conserve the environment.

        <div class="row">
          <h2>Now</h2>
